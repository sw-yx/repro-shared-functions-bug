this reproduces [the shared folders bug in netlify dev](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-dev-plugin/issues/192).

- deployed: https://app.netlify.com/sites/gallant-bartik-bc2de8
- see error: https://gallant-bartik-bc2de8.netlify.com/.netlify/functions/hworld1

in netlify functions in production, we cannot share folders like we do here

however this raises no errors in netlify dev
